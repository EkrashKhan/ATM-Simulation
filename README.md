ATM Simulation in C++

This is a simple ATM Simulation project built in C++ using basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The program allows a user to:

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Check account balance

Exit the system

It includes input validation to prevent invalid entries (like negative deposits or withdrawing more than the available balance).
The project demonstrates the use of classes, encapsulation, and user interaction handling in C++.
